# PetroleumPredictor

## Description:

PetroleumPredictor is an iOS based application that uses Image Recognition software on images 
uploaded by the user to estimate the volume of an oil spill based on sheen detection and the 
color of the sheen. Currently, the app can identify and calculate the volume of an oil spill
that has a dark brown/crude sheen, rainbow sheen, metallic sheen, or a silver sheen, based 
on the image the user uploads.

## Usage:
This app can be used on any oil spills that contain oils with the sheens mentioned above. The
application will ask the user to enter an image from their library, enter the height of the spill
in meters, and the width of the spill in meters. After pressing the calcuate button, the Petroleum
Predictor will output an estimated volume of the oil spill in cubic meters.
